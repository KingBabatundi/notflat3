                                  Born in Italy, raised in Spain and Astrid Stavro recently joined Pentagram London, leaving Atlas the studio she co-founded with Pablo Martín. A highly respected and outspoken graphic designer, Stavro stresses the “soul” in design over any visual quality and sat down with me to explore society's and graphic design’s continuous stumble into an uncertain future.
                                  <br><br>
                                  <strong>-- Hello Astrid.</strong>
                                  <br><br>
                                  Hello.
                                  <br><br>
                                  <strong>-- Let’s get started with a broad question. What frustrates you most about the graphic design industry/practice?</strong>
                                  <br><br>
                                  God… Honestly, I don't why I am a graphic designer. I think about it every day. Before I joined here, I told all my friends that I was becoming a fisherwoman because I couldn’t say it was Pentagram. And then the day it was announced, they all went “OH MY GOD! But you didn't become a fisherwoman. You became a partner!” And I said, Well, it's the same thing, I’m just fishing a different kind of fish.
                                  <br><br>
                                  <strong>-- Are you’re looking for something with more purpose, is that it? </strong>
                                  <br><br>
                                  I have always had a problem with graphic design as a service similarly to how I have a problem with advertising. Like Charlie Chaplin in Modern Times<span class="footnote"></span>, graphic design forms a part of a system that sells junk, and there is enough junk. We do not need more. Advertising contributes a lot to that and so keeping the pure aspect of graphic design is challenging. You can see it more in small artisanal studios, who do more cultural design and less shampoo selling.
                                   <br><br>
                                   We are all part of this society designed to keep us entertained until we eventually die. We need distractions all the time - the new Volvic, the new iPhone, the new fashion trend - and everything becomes a distraction from what really matters: each other, love, family. We are here for a very short time. So we better do something useful and not necessarily a shampoo and its packaging. So that’s one frustrating aspect of design.
                                          <br><br>
                                          Another very frustrating aspect is that graphic design is a very self-referential industry. Graphic designers have big egos. They think they are the hottest shit when actually they are just normal human beings. Stefan Sagmeister actually said, “being a famous graphic designer is like being a famous electrician." I think it is really true but the industry continuously creates idols. We are so narcissistic in the way the canon of graphic design has been written, which includes an enormous lack of women, people of colour, and across the board is just wrong. It contributes to the self-referential attitudes of graphic designers.
                                          <br><br>
                                          What is also super frustrating, is the lack of critical thinking and critical writing. Criticism is necessary. Otherwise, we do not grow and become better. We have a lot of these design magazines, design blogs, design journals, design news sites etc, but it is just design-porn that is being put out there. 
                                  <br><br>
                                  <strong>-- As you just said graphic design is a discipline that does an awful little amount of debating and critiquing. The most famous graphic design news sites are not a source of debate or critique, but of infectious PR spin. So could you expand on your thoughts on the lack of criticism in graphic design? And are you being openly critical enough of the industry?</strong>
                                  <br><br>
                                  We do need more platforms for criticism to happen. Eye Magazine and The Design Observer are places were criticism happens. I do think the Design Observer was better some years ago. These are the two only prominent places, which is not enough. However, there are more and more blogs simply showing us “nice work.” It is just design-porn. There is nothing in their journalism that interesting from a critical perspective. In working for Alliance Graphique Internationale, the Typo Circle and now Pentagram and I speak with journalists all the time. And it is so frustrating to write the press releases for them and they just copy and paste them into an article. People really do not know how to conduct criticism.
                                          <br><br>
                                          I do see, which is great, that there more students who are doing work to promote more design criticism. For example, Gute Process is an online magazine.<span class="footnote"></span> They do very in-depth interviews and essays on design criticism. Michael Klein who started it is a very a young, smart guy in his early twenties. Gute Process actually interviewed me about this tweet I had made about Jessica Walsh’s Instagram account, which went kind of viral. I made a point that when you are as powerful as Jessica, you have a responsibility that comes in messages that you send across. And if you only post pictures of you looking pretty, what is your message to younger people that really look up to you? It is not about being dogmatic. We all express ourselves in a different way. It was just in Jessica’s case, with hundreds of thousands of followers, there is a certain duty to consider what you are putting out there.
                                          <br><br>
                                          I got asked to do a lecture in reaction to Jessica Walsh and the backlash I received. I realised how vitriol things are on social networks. They are not places where constructive criticism is welcome. They are a populistic machine that runs on its own. It’s scary stuff. We should consider how we communicate through all these different channels? Who we are and how those all of this mosaic make up who we are and how do we express ourselves through these channels?
                                          <br><br>
                                          And what am criticism am I doing? Well, I didn't give this lecture… yet! And I am trying to get the partners (at Pentagram) to be more active, to publish and express their opinions publicly. The problem with our industry is that no one wants to be honest because we are all friends and people are reliant on each other. The entire industry from a design to a journalistic and editorial perspective is helping each other. The design magazines need the designers that feed them content. And so the moment, you start commenting and constructively criticizing others you risk damaging relationships.
                                  <br><br>
                                  <strong>-- But shouldn’t these design magazines have a responsibility to critique when they have millions of readers?</strong>
                                  <br><br>
                                  The magazine editors do not want to start critiquing because what they do works really well, precisely because it is easy. It is really easy to go say “It’s nice.” Yet, the moment you start having a thinking platform. You are going to lose thousands of followers. What do people want? They do not want to read about shit-boring, anal graphic design criticism. The only thing they care about is having a pint and looking at cool stuff. At the end of the day, that is a lot of what happens.
                                          <br><br>
                                          I must stress that any design criticism must be constructive. Otherwise, it risks creating an unbalanced and vitriol debate.
                                  <br><br>
                                  <strong>-- Metahaven wrote this in their book Can Jokes bring down Governments? “Any historical picture of graphic design as a discipline inhabited by socially concerned humanist fighting for the better of the world is a gross misrepresentation of the discipline has to offer.”<span class="footnote"></span> What do you think of this statement?</strong>
                                  <br><br>
                                  No, I disagree. I don't think that a picture of graphic design concerned with humanists or social things is a gross misinterpretation of graphic design. This quote is difficult to judge extracted out of the blue. I would have to understand the context in which they said it.
                                          <br><br>
                                          Graphic design is applied to socially concerned aspects, for example, a political campaign, like Michael Beirut’s campaign for Hillary Clinton or Tonic Design for the Socialist Party in Holland. These are just political campaigns, but I think graphic design can do fantastic things. One of the things that keeps me alive is precisely is in thinking. How can I apply graphic design to make the world a better place? I know this sounds so cute, but If I were here to design shampoos or, you know, beers or whatever new startup thing, then my life would be really meaningless.
                                  <br><br>
                                  <strong>-- You seem to convey a sense of social responsibility in the world. You’ve said, “as a designer you have to imagine yourself in someone else's shoes”. That might have referred to thinking about the client and the consumer. But from what I’ve read, it seems you consider what you put out into the world. However, other graphic design practitioners are not the same. Chermayeff & Geismar - who designed the visual identities for Chase Manhattan, National Geographic, NBC, PBS etc. declared that it is none of their business to evaluate the ethics of their clients' practice. “We do not feel responsible for the character of those we work for.” Thoughts?</strong>
                                  <br><br>
                                  No, I disagree again. I do love their work…. Pfff, I’m a little surprised they think about this. You do have to question who you work for and what they do. We had a meeting here at Pentagram with the London partners the day after Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist, was killed in Turkey. There was a big multi-million-pound project that had come in from Saudi Arabia. Only three of the partners were involved but they had to ask permission because the project would affect the whole company. So we voted on it. Everybody unanimously raised their hands, “we're not gonna work for Saudi Arabia.” Things like that happened more often that you would expect. Yes, there is definitely a responsibility to consider who you work for.
                                  <br><br>
                                  <strong>-- Graphic design is slow in changing curricula to challenge the current political and social context. Political and social concerns seem extraneous or inappropriate to the profession. It seems very often subservient to the market. Should graphic design be doing more?</strong>
                                  <br><br>
                                  It depends. I mean if you have something to say and you feel very strongly about something, whether you're a graphic designer or an electrician, you go out and do it. We can all do it. Graphic designers just have the immediately necessary design tools. If you have nothing to say it's better that you don’t say anything, but if you feel strongly about something, definitely.
                                  <br><br>
                                  <strong>-- We’ll move on to talk about technology and its effect on us. We are entering a world where machines make decisions we cannot understand or follow, and the systems are being used against us. Humans are increasingly fighting against these technologies - through the fetishisation of retro, the return of film photography to the mainstream, increased priority on the physicality in design, the rise of physical books, dressing more in vintage clothing and doing more things by hand. Yet, technology is also changing us. We demand single answers in a complicated world that do not exist and people are getting manipulated into fundamental populism and conspiracy theories. People are changing their physical to match their online avatars and social media usage is disrupting elections and causing increased mental health in children.
                                      <br><br>
                                      So the question is quite open. What concerns you most about technology right now as an individual?</strong>
                                  <br><br>
                                  I totally think that Marshall McLuhan was a super visionary. In Medium is the Message, he said that “all media are extensions of some human faculty - psychic or physical”.<span class="footnote"></span> I couldn't agree more and he said that in 1967! The alarming thing for me is that because we're so immersed in the technological revolution, or whatever you want to call it, that we don't know where we're going. What’s happening with artificial intelligence and algorithms? Who will be controlling it? And what's happening with Google and Amazon who are becoming these huge monopolies controlling everything in people's lives? These massive corporate conglomerates, dominating the personal information of everyone, and, like what you’ve shown so eloquently with your book of copy and pasting people’s information, they transforming us into numbers, It's really scary. We need to stick together and start organizing committees to question where we're going. The topic needs to hit the mainstream to empower the debates because if not, who knows what will happen. For me, it is the gloomiest thing.
                                  <br><br>
                                  <strong>-- What concerns you most about technology right now as a designer?</strong>
                                  <br><br>
                                  Possibly Instagram. Now it is Instagram but in the future, it is going to be something else. Social media platforms are not space where thinking in any way whatsoever seems to be welcomed. The drive behind them is the opposite. All these platforms are propagandistic and self-advertisement. This fake transparency of showing the music I listen to, what I like, my tastes and this is the name of fucking my dog or whatever. This striptease of who we are publically, I find it disturbing. What do I care about the name of your dog? It's fake. It’s fake humility. It’s fake everything. I mean, your dog is probably real, but these platforms are about curating an image of ourselves to the outside world of who we would like to be instead of who we actually are. We're not gonna put our farts or how stinky we wake up in the morning. We don't put all those things. Instead, we put all the nice bits. It's like a curated vitrine of bullshit.  
                                  <br><br>
                                  <strong>-- Would you say a bit about how technology plays a role in your work and what are the challenges your practice has in the next decade? </strong>
                                  <br><br>
                                  I use a computer like everybody else. However, I do consider it a tool and I do not let the tool do the thinking. The big danger is that some designers might let the tool do everything. It is our brain doing things first and then it's fantastic to have technological tools allowing us to do to all the incredible things we imagine. But if we let the tools do the thinking then we're not gonna go anywhere. And that’s the biggest challenge of my practice.  
                                   <br><br>
                                  <strong>-- The “artificial intelligence/robot takeover” is a little while away for the creative industry but the infusion of that automated design process is already here. We only have to go upstairs to Jody Hudson-Powell and Luke Powell and see their work for Graphcore and see how that relationship might evolve. Do you do you see your practice becoming automated? For example, where the algorithms do the work but there is a designer to give the final approval?</strong>
                                  <br><br>
                                  I don't find anything threatening in that. I do find it fascinating actually that maybe we (algorithms and I) collaborate on something. Often, I look at what happens in Luke and Jody’s screens and see these amazing things. I wouldn’t mind being their intern! (Laughing).
                                    <br><br>
                                    One of the reasons for joining Pentagram was the opportunity to work with guys like John Marshall, Yuri Suzuki, Luke and Jody that do this mind-blowing work. And to be able to collaborate that’s great. I think there is an opportunity for growth and learning from each other and these technologies can do amazing things. I definitely see myself wanting to use those technologies moving forward.
                                  <br><br>
                                  <strong>-- We see the boundaries of the internet are blurring. Hito Steyerl said that the internet is moving offline,<span class="footnote"></span> humans are moving online and are the lines are too blurry to tell the difference and just yesterday the Guardian wrote an article titled “Where is the boundary between your phone and mind?.”<span class="footnote"></span> We are not the creators of the technology but we are the creators of the interfaces, images, platforms, icons, advertisements that are used to navigate the digital realm and the physical realm. Do we, as designers, have a responsibility to consider what we design and we put out there what is the impact?</strong>
                                  <br><br>
                                  Definitely. We have an absolute responsibility for shaping our sons’ and daughters’ future and the world they will inherit. It is the same responsibility we have towards the climate. We have a responsibility for absolutely everything happening in particular with technology and artificial intelligence. We can now make babies grow in plastic bottles and test-tubes. What if we start reproducing human beings like in Brave New World? We then start making copies of each other and this kind of thing… You can’t play God because none of us is God. It's a very fine line. I think, yes we have an enormous responsibility in EVERYTHING.

                                  <strong>-- Could the answer for graphic designers be to create speculative work that by predicting future scenarios comments on the current trajectory of today?</strong>
                                  <br><br>
                                  Yeah, I think speculative work is one of the ways of doing that. Interactive design is another. But it is about thinking… Thinking. It's about thinking why we do what we do and what we do it for.

                                    -- Hi Chris. How are you?</strong>
                                    <br><br>
                                    Hello, I’m good. Thank you. 
                                     <br><br>
                                    <strong>-- So what frustrates you most about the graphic design industry practice?</strong>
                                    <br><br>
                                    Probably at the moment, the thing that frustrates me most is the way in which people outside the industry talk about the industry. There is a perception that graphic design is almost wasteful. I say that from experience. This means whenever there's a discussion about a new brand it inevitably focuses on the logo and on it being a waste of money. This perception undervalues not only the effort that goes in naturally from all of the people involved because it's never just one designer. It's always a team. The perception undervalues the impact that design can have. I think really good design is positive commercially and socially. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    The role of design is to add benefit and graphic design should add value. Now that might be aesthetic value, it might be informational value (as to how to make things clearer for people) or even commercial value of just straightening things up, so that you're not wasting money on reinventing the wheel every time. If it’s good, graphic design always adds some kind of value. If it’s bad, it can be a waste of money. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    <strong>-- In a presentation at Web Summit, <span class="footnote"></span>
                                    you’ve said that brands have to brave, but shouldn’t we designers be brave as well. Why don’t graphic designers voice their opinions about the industry and world around them more? What are graphic designers responsibilities to the world? Socially, politically and environmentally?</strong>
                                    <br><br>
                                    Good question. It is essential that designers are brave. As a designer, it is important that you get people to ask questions as much as solve questions. For example, a new redesign of Slack launched yesterday. <span class="footnote"></span> It's quite good. It's very practical. I’m sure it fulfils much of what was asked in the brief. There's some negative response online. I'm always reluctant to be negative about other people's work as it is not necessarily helpful. Anyway, a lot of the challenges being raised about this new redesign are actually whether it is differentiating, special or different. There is value in looking into this argument as I think designers have a real role to invent stuff that people haven't seen before. It is challenging particularly when you've got technology companies whose mission is to make things as frictionless and as simple as possible. This includes user design and user experience. The danger is you create design that becomes soulless and similar to everything else.
                                    <br><br>
                                    One thing Wolff Olins has always focused on and, me personally, is creating things that are like no other. Always trying to be deliberately different and purposefully different, even if that pisses people off and even if that makes people say it is a waste of money. At least, it challenges people to think about things that they haven't considered before. That's where the other stuff comes in about having a kind of social conscience. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Again, if we think about Wolff Olins, I've been here 15 years and why I stay is because we care about the stuff we put out into the world. We care about the world. I think it's important you have a point of view on why you're making something and whether the product or the company is adding value as well. Not to say you should always just work for charities. However, there should always be a positive reason why you're working with an organization. The mission is to make the job of design to amplify the good within. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    <strong>-- But why don't designers voice or more openly criticize? Designers I’ve interviewed say it’s important but none of them really do it. </strong>
                                    <br><br>
                                    I think graphic designer are scared. Often it would mean turning down a job. I think we (Wolff Olins) are in a lucky position our reputation means that were able sometimes to walk away from clients. If you are an independent and you rely on monthly revenue, it's very hard to turn down a client. Part of why people don't voice their opinions is the fear of losing work. That’s a shame because if more people would, then we would change things. It is easy for me to say that sat here on the ninth floor of a building that Omnicom owns. I’m playing with their money. You have to appreciate that it is different if you are a smaller independent studio where you have to take every opportunity that arrives. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    <strong>-- Your studio's report 'Radical Everything' <span class="footnotes"></span> claimed that businesses should be vehicles of social change. Other studios don’t seem to agree so much. Chermayeff & Geismar - who designed the Chase Manhattan corporate identity, National Geographic, NBC, PBS, declared that it is none of their business to evaluate the ethics of their clients' practice. “We do not feel responsible for the character of those we work for.” <span class="footnote"></span> Do you agree?</strong>
                                    <br><br>
                                    Uhmm… no, I don't agree. In proxy of being involved in representing companies external characteristics, you are responsible for their character to a degree. I can understand where they're coming from. My argument is not that all designer should be saying “we will only work with companies that already do and are good for the world.” You should try to wherever are adding value to be that critical voice in the room. I’ve spent a lot of time in meeting rooms and boardrooms with CEOs where we are able to be the critical voice. Now whether your critical voice is heard or not that is a different question. Yet, we are able to have that voice and I think it's important that people take that opportunity. Because that is how changes are made, by kind of chipping things away a little bit, telling clients “you cannot be saying that because it's not true.”
                                    <br><br>
                                    They are always going to be organizations which we would never work with, like the arms industry or cigarettes. However, there's always going to be a challenge with any organization that you work with. If you work with an FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) brand or a supermarket brand, you know that you are dealing with the obesity crisis because they sell lots of products, like crisps and chocolate. There is a way of looking at the graphic designer as responsible for the obesity crisis. Well yes, you are kind of responsible to a degree. Yet, you can do what you can to add some positive value. That might just be a case of helping people to understand and consider this products as a part of a responsible diet. I don’t think you can you can completely remove yourself from responsibility. I think that is a bit of a cop-out. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    <strong>-- From what I’m gauging it seems like if there is line graphic designers have to tread. As an add-on to this, but how about the perception that Wolff Olins, when working with Uber, <span class="footnote"></span> turned a blind eye to their infamous scandals and their, in polite terms, inconsiderate ethical and moral standards. <span class="footnote"></span>
                                    </strong>
                                    <br><br>
                                    One of the reasons we worked with Uber, and enjoyed working with them, is because they’re in a moment of change. We’ve worked with big banks, with supermarkets like Tesco who had a lot of negative stories in the early years of our relationship with them. These companies wanted to change. That's true of all our clients. The reason why we take on certain jobs because we can help create that change. Are we responsible for how that plays out from there onwards? Not necessarily. Any big complex organization are difficult. We’ve worked with Barclays for years and they had all kinds of issues and involvement and responsibility for the banking crisis. Yet, there were people within who wanted to change and the briefs that we've got where about accelerating or magnifying that change. I think as long as we're working on that that makes sense to me.
                                     <br><br>
                                    <strong>-- My friend asked this question to Mother London. Can branding ever be authentic? Iceland (the supermarket) now supports the rainforest <span class="footnote"></span> and Cosmopolitan now supports “plus-size models”<span class="footnote"></span>, but it all seems layered in a convenient attempt to improve their reputation and their sales, as cultural attitudes shift. What do you do to make sure that brands you work for are authentic? </strong>
                                    <br><br>
                                    The key is to see if something is genuinely part of the fabric of a business via the initial brief and early research into that organisation. To be authentic, it will normally be involved in the commercial side of the business. It won't be run by a small team that’s away from the boardroom. It will have the backing of the CEO. It'll be vocalized and have the involvement of the board. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    It's a really good question. How do you know? Sometimes it is good instinct. A lot of what designers do is good instinct and then we try to come up with models, structures, approaches and documentation around it. I’ve done this a long, long time and I have been good at figuring out who’s bullshitting. Often, doing a job is two years of your life. I don't want to give two years of my life to people are bullshitting me. I do appreciate that we are in a slightly lucky position to be able to reject briefs. It’s not something I take lightly. It's one of the reasons why I keep getting inspired by this place because we attract people who feel authentic and are genuine. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    <strong>-- What concerns you most about technology (social media, big tech, data collection, surveillance) right now as an individual? </strong>
                                    <br><br>
                                    I’ve just been writing about this for a brief for an organisation that is very technologically focused and doing work with machine learning. One of the biggest worries we've got is that we are so worried about it! We're not really getting engaged with it. I read newspaper reports about what we gonna do when AI finally strikes. It is already here. It is already happening!
                                    <br><br>
                                    The involvement of technology is inseparable from our daily life. My daughter wakes up and the first thing she does is ask for the iPad so she can watch Minions. She's integrated into technology from two-years-old, operating an iPad with the same dexterity as her grandma. We worry that it is ruining us or rotting our brains. I really don't think it is. We should look at the now as a fantastic time to be living in, where we can still direct technology, use it to our advantage and power humanity. We're not enslaved by it. We're not trapped by it. We are just not utilizing it as well as we could. I think that's the biggest worry I have about it. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Do I think that technology will replace me my job? No. Because of those things we talked about earlier. Because I've got instinct and the ability to walk into a room and sense another human beings feelings. Because of the ability to pull an idea out of nowhere. Do I think technology will replace a lot of people who are bad at their job? Yes. I think a massive amount of people will lose their jobs in the design industry. However, they'll be the ones that are doing the type of work that can be done by robots. Repetitive non-thinking and unconnected to the real world. Those that are trotting stuff out for the sake of it, replacing them will be a good thing. The work will then become more imaginative. It will empower people to think in bigger and brighter ways. It will encourage people to do the weirder stuff. One of the downsides of technological advancement over the last few years is the blandness of everything. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    <strong>--You’ve said that publically several times. Brands are boring. Is that what concerns you about technology as a designer?</strong>
                                    <br><br>
                                    It drives me nuts! A quarter of brands could disappear overnight and no one would give a shit. Brands are boring and I genuinely believe it should be the opposite. Why is branding and identity becoming formulaic? We've got more tools and yet we're using them to do fewer things in already-done ways. It is because we rely on the tool to do the work wherein that freedom would have normally been. The unexpected accident and the ability to go on a tangent is lost. An algorithm will not take you to a place you haven’t been. An algorithm will always take you to a place where you expect it to go. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    The one thing we’re trying to push this year is to do deliberately weirder stuff. To do stuff that looks like nothing else! To do stuff that breaks our boundary: whether it's in terms of a technological boundary, whether it's visual terms or whether it's in terms of like how we integrate a brand with other brands. The opportunity is huge. Unfortunately, everybody is currently funnelling down to a singular point. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    I'm massively excited by technology. I'm really excited by how we can exploit it as opposed to what it's doing to us. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    <strong>-- Maybe you can just clarify, what do you see the biggest challenge of your profession is to itself and the outside world? In relation to technology and the other aspects, we talked about today. </strong>
                                    <br><br>
                                    One of the biggest challenges is maintaining integrity. By integrity, I mean the combination of individuality and belief. They’re something about getting an idea from the centre of your head out into the world, which is the reason I get excited about a job I’ve been doing for twenty odd years. It is an amazing thing. The idea there is a formula or that it’s replicable just makes me sad.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I feel incredibly privileged to do the job. There are lots of people who have much harder lives. All designers are really privileged because they get to essentially play. It is essentially the same joy my daughter has when she sits down with a pack of crayons. She's basically doing the same thing that Dad does every day, which is an amazing thing. We should all be proud to have that role. However, in order to encourage it to continue, we've got to ensure that this special quality is maintained - inventing, dreaming and coming up with stuff hasn't been done before. To be passionate, to be vocal and getting in people’s faces and saying this is a different way to do things. Not just following a crowd but trying every single day to do something we did not do yesterday.

                                    <strong>- -I’ve started to become aware of the nearly complete absence of critique in design. It’s perhaps only Eye on Design or the DesignObserver. There is no critical or constructive design discussion. Very little of a designers’ role is about criticism and taking the industry responsible for things taking place. What would it require for designers - in prominent positions - to be vocal and be critical? </strong>

                                    It is almost to remember what we learned at college. Every three days you would have a crit. A crit is a short form of critique. Critique is about being really additive with what your viewpoint is. You can make a negative point but you do it in an additive sense. On blogs what’s annoying at the moment is that things are shortcut to critique. It's not real criticism. There's nothing additive in there.

                                    It will take a few people getting together.  Maybe a new type of forum away from the current platforms. Current platforms aren’t sparking the type of debate you want to have. There needs to be new spaces for people to feel confident that they’re not gonna get shot down. The downside about being vocal is the potential reciprocal onslaught and bombardment from social media, which creates unease about voicing your opinion consistently. All it will take is a couple of people change it though.

                                    Perceived competitors could be working together. A bit like football teams. You play against each other but you’re still going to standing up for what football is. Maybe it just Brexit inspiring me, but perhaps there should cross-party alliances to help this. A voice made up of significant senior people from the most recognizable agencies coming out and having a voice. That level of a platform would be interesting. Maybe trying to get out of the inner circle getting into a vocal public platform on a world stage, in order to try talking about the influence of design on a fundamental level. This may require getting people who are currently competitors to achieve it, but then we’ll start having a discussion outside of ‘this kerning is off’ and ‘this logo is rubbish.’

It’s not like you could even oppress it. If you’re putting stuff out into the world, you cannot complain about people having an opinion about it.

                                    If it is an opinionated approach, it shouldn’t be a single person's’ opinion of a piece of work, it should be a kind of rounded understanding from a group of people's review or a balanced take on it.

                                    Hmmm… I think what’s missing in design is a broader understanding that we are collective group. Design can get too tribal. We should do more to stay focused on considering ourselves as a group in a world and hold each other accountable.

                                  There is a structural distinctness of the digital simulated life and the organic physical life. We all know social media and the internet operate differently from real life. The internet functions on an availability bias since only the novelty and the loud have any chance of maintaining their presence in all the noise. Without knowledge of the societal effects, people are submitted into a digital augmented society that treats imitation and authentic similarly. We are submerged into a world filled with spaces that affect every part of our lives without much awareness of the ramifications. This aligns with the thoughts of the internet moving offline, the continuing externalising and the potential merge of the self and the potential further investigation into the impacts of each.

                                  Design is not merely a tool it is also a lens. It must be comfortable with ambiguity but also with accidents. Unfortunately, design has taken the approach of “it has to be" too universally and in the long run has created problems. There are two ways of designing. There is designing for how user imagine the systems to work and creating interfaces (things that users interact with) that satisfy those preconceived beliefs. The other way of designing is to create interfaces that demystify or remove preconception of these objects or wider social or personal preconceptions which is harder to do. Unfortunately, the former approach has created interfaces that are becoming self-perpetuating, self-reaffirming lenses for how users see the world. Unsurprisingly, the result globally is a narrowing worldview through infinite mirroring. However, I do appreciate that when I sit in a chair or open my computer it works the way I expect it to.

                                  In future fragments, you must discuss the cause of the externalised compartmentalised self with examples of how they interact and how those in doubt of its existence could be convinced. Also, expand how the design of these platforms have allowed the consciousness to be embedded into the digital.

                                  The self can be located within and outside the physical body and thus the self becomes locationally uncommitted. It is only committed to being uncommitted, distributed and decentralised. The self operates throughout the Interzone. A distributed networked system which has no respect to the boundaries of the material world, body or brain. Similarly to how Donald Merlin discusses how there is a distributed cognition in which “from birth, the rapidly growing human brain is immersed in a massively distributed cognitive network: culture.”<span class="footnote"></span> This same development occurs with self. The notion that the self is contained within the confines of your physical self can be challenged, especially as we have gone from an extensive, analogue and linear world to one that is intensive, non-linear and compartmentalised. The digital world operates not only as a kind of memory store, for remembrance of events (ie. calendars) or a processes, (ie. calculators ), but now creates spaces for the self to manifest in, express desires, have interactions and change perspective separate from the physical world. Perhaps, this compartmentalisation of the self should be accepted as an inevitable result of the further optimisation of the human environment towards more efficient ways of inhabiting our world. The quantified selfs dream of an angelised body has already arrived but not in the way the movement imagined.

                                  "Every machine is a part of a system of machines, and in that system, between them, they integrate every sort of flow. Therefore there can never be a starting point and an ending point for a process: the flow is simply transformed through the interruption, it cannot be said to have a "final cause," and any attempt to limit the flow--for instance, portraying desire as something originating with a subject and ending with an object--is a camouflage operation for the actually unlimited flow. Machines make it look like there are actually beginnings and endings in the flow, providing us with an illusion of production, consumption, et cetera. If we see past this property of machines, we can understand that we are never "molecular" or "nomadic" or whatever: we are only "becoming-molecular."<span class="footnote"></span>

                                   I think that this relates substantially to the main thrust of Deleuze and Guattari's work, which is the production of a tenable alternative to the power and knowledge structured world articulated by Foucault. For Foucault, a subject is always created and delimited by power. Thus, describing the subject as a system of machines that function as interruptions allows us to see past this illusionary subjectivity to the fluidity of flows.
                                  <br><br> 
                                   There is no beginning and end in our world. Even humans are just machines that work and produce (see earlier entry for definition). The idea that the digital self being a cause of the digital self can be argued against using this theory. The relationship between the externalised self and the physical self is a flow not a linear process. One does not know where one ends or where one begins or which action caused a reaction in the other. It is one and the same

                                  A machine is an "assemblage of parts that works and produces,”<span class="footnote"></span> according to Giles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. Thus, a machine is just something that operates conditionally to material flow and can be extended to include human beings. It removes the distinction between the organic, the physical human, and the inorganic, the digital or mechanical. A simple conjecture would be that the extension of the bodily operations of humankind and the fusion of the human digital self and physical self is not an “unnatural” evolution. We are just becoming more fragmented machines operating and producing in more ways than we were previously able to.

                                <strong>-- Hello Peter.</strong>
                                <br><br>
                                Hello Jonathan.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>-- You have a chapter on the quantified self in your new (unreleased) book. What is the quantified self-movement? And what are the positives and negatives of this movement? </strong>
                                <br><br>
                                Quantified Self, with capital q and capital s, is a movement started by Kevin Kelly and Gary Wolf.<span class=”footnote”></span> There is also the lowercase quantified self, like the movement sociologist Deborah Lupton discusses in her book with the same name.<span class="footnote"></span> The actual movement started in California by former Wired magazine editors in 2011. They have an annual conference, international online group meetings and a big expo conference where all the tech companies also show up and sell their latest biometric sensors. What they celebrate is what they call ‘self-knowledge through numbers’. The conference and the expo are very much about people standing up saying, “I’ve been measuring my heart rate for a year and this is how it correlates with my activity”.
                                <br><br>
                                The movement varies from what seems incredibly narcissistic and frankly pointless to a genuine interest in the notion that whereby sharing data we can improve our understanding of the body and take control of healthcare. The latter is the side that I respect. Thus, instead of you showing up to the doctor saying, “There's something wrong with me. I don't know what it is.” Or feeling like you go to a hospital and surrender to a system that just tells you about your body. You actually have an understanding of your body and how it functions, and you've grown that knowledge through sharing with others. The chapter in my book is very much about how the quantified self-movement owes a lot of its methods to kind of productivist mindset.
                                <br><br>
                               
                                <strong>-- So the mindset that by collecting and harvesting data about yourself you can become more effective? </strong>
                                <br><br>
                                Yes, which links philosophically to the idea of the Industrial Age. A combination of puritanical Protestant work ethic plus industrialisation. How we can make the human body more efficient for the production of capital. The idea is very interesting to critique the quantified self movement through because it means that when I turn on my watch to time my journey home or upload it to Strava, there is a direct link to Taylorism - the early 20th century stop motion studies by Frederick Taylor.<span class="footnote"></span> He studied how long the worker on the assembly line took to move this widget from here to there 15,000 times, in order to figure out how it could be done to boost productivity. It's very helpful to think critically about what we're doing to ourselves when we ‘quantify ourselves’ and whose standards we're measuring ourselves against.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>-- Let’s keep exploring this topic. The claims of big data, machine learning and AI are that inputs suitability quantified might be processed to predict and thus control future outcomes. This is often called the datafication of the world.
                                <br><br>
                                What are the potential dangers of this belief especially in relation to the quantified self-movement? </strong>
                                <br><br>
                                Evgeny Morozov writes about this very critically. He skewers the quantified self-movement and describes their approaches as ‘Taylorism within’.<span class="footnote"></span> Somehow we have incorporated the assembly line logic of the early 20th century and turned it on ourselves, which fits very much with the neoliberal mindset.
                                <br><br>
                                So to use healthcare as an example, by us personally becoming responsible for our own healthcare, it counters the idea of healthcare being a social service or national service. At the same time what you're implying is that there is a surveillance side to all this. In uploading our data continuously, we're potentially making our data available to insurance companies who can then gauge the price of our life insurance based on the data that we've voluntarily uploaded. This is a really slippery slope of turning ourselves into, let’s say, quantifiable commodities.. for free! and for the benefit of large corporations. All voluntarily.
                                <br><br>
                               
                                <strong> -- You wrote a book about mapping published by the Minnesota Press.<span class="footnote"></span> So as we map the environment, the human body and the human experience through quantifiable metrics, what do you predict to happen to society? What if humans become obsessed with constantly updating themselves? </strong>
                                <br><br>
                                I mean I'm definitely not a techno-utopian. I don't think self-knowledge through numbers is an idea that can be embraced without reservations. I was just reading that Nicholas Carr essay that was distributed to your class on Tuesday.<span class="footnote"></span> He makes a very open notion that we shape our tools and thereafter they shape us, as Marshall McLuhan said. The things that were invented are changing the way we behave or even the way our brains work. So I like that Nicholas Carr essay because he's quite honest about his inability to read long texts anymore. That's quite a really interesting way into the critique by starting with what it was doing to him.  I'm not total dystopian. I just think that what is needed is a critical awareness about what we're doing to ourselves with our inventions, so we can use them sensibly with caution. Also, we should be thinking about how to subvert them so that the agendas written into them can be turned to creative or subversive purposes. I’m probably somewhere in between. Definitely, I don't think we're powerless.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>-- Right now there is a dystopian scenario playing out, which I wanted us to discuss. It is indicative of what the quantified self-movement may cause. China has been piloting their social credit system since 2015<span class="footnote"></span> in ‘small villages,’ which in China is millions and millions of people. Each citizen gets a 1000 points. Good deeds (returning a wallet, donating, volunteer work) boost your score, bad deeds (stealing, racketeering, even beating your wife) reduces your score. Positive scores can lead to better interest rates, loans housing, education etc. However, others with lower ratings have been blocked from certain services. For example, if you have below 950 points you’re blocked from certain services. 11,000,000 Chinese citizens have been blocked from buying flights under the pilot programme. The system launches in 2020, possibly reducing every interaction to a transaction. The mass quantified self-movement. China is datafied the entire population to ‘increase performance.’ Thoughts on this phenomenon? </strong>
                                <br><br>
                                I mean my immediate reaction is horror actually. Because it's extending the quantification beyond profit-making to a punitive system. It’s a form of discipline and punishment to use Foucault terms. One part that really troubles me is related to how I've been collecting error messages. They are really interesting because we come across them every day and we get frustrated, but we think it is just normal. It seems there are more and more error messages. “You cannot access this service”. “Sorry, this is not available at this time.” “Sorry, our system is down blah blah blah” So imagine combining this inevitability of error messages with a big data method of punitive, discipline-and-control method organizing society that seems to be piloted in China as you're describing. For the most innocent person, you could suddenly find your data scores wiped. Maybe you’ve done something that was misinterpreted and it's dropped your score so you can't access services. We’re all familiar with the frustration of trying to appeal to a machine against the decision. I can only imagine how awful that would be. Suppose you can't access the NHS anymore because you've been reported to have vandalized your neighbour's car. It seems like the removal of a fair system of law that's overseen by a social contract of people and replaced by algorithms and numbers. I find it a little bit terrifying.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>-- It was good to hear your thoughts as often the topic is discussed as a future scenario, but these developments are occurring right now. We talked a bit about what is happening more generally to the human population and the quantified self-movement, so let’s focus in on the individual person.
                                <br><br>
                                -- In Regimen of Visibility and Vigilance in the Era of Digital Identity, Alejandra Lopez Gabrieldis investigates the relation between data and the self.<span class="footnote"></span> She said thanks ‘to the possibility of storing, recording and replaying data from human daily behaviour, humans are creating a reflective mirror one that is interactive of capable of driving an actor to comply’. Thus, aren’t we all part of the quantified self-movement as we can track our behaviour everywhere? Where do the distinctions lie between the quantified self- movement and any other individual today?</strong>
                                <br><br>
                                It’s hard to not come off sounding like a complete Luddite. I don't think it's is advantageous to think all technology is terrible and say “Look at social media. We should cancel it now.” But rather consider what the effects are and then adjust our behaviour or the technology accordingly.
                                <br><br>
                                For example, we really ought to be trying other search engines than Google which uses cookies, tracks everything and caters searches according to our history.  There were other types of mapping system before Google became the default. These resistances to these phenomena are fascinating. For example, how people have responded to Google Street View. Open Street Maps is a type of resistance because it’s a wiki style mapping service or Michael Wolfe who went through all the Google Street View footage and found people giving the finger to the Street View cars, compiling them all in one exhibition.<span class="footnote"></span> Acts of resistance are not only creative and entertaining but are important to draw our attention to the unconscious effects of technology.
                                <br><br>
                                To come back to your question, the distinction may lie in a term called the obligatory passage point. This is where technology is purposely developed to the point where everybody is forced to use it. So Google Maps is an example and even more universally is mp3, where there was a large debate amongst sound engineers about the most suitable methods for compressing music. Interestingly, mp3 was one of worst quality compressions. Yet, it backfired in the end, when people again started questioning whether mp3 was the most suitable method of compression. The backfiring happens when the obligatory passage point stops functioning as supposed to, is overridden or subverted. Sometimes it is market forces. However other times it is creative interventions and refusals that help that happen. I'm not saying all obligatory passage points are bad but it's a useful term for understanding how technology forces us to comply to use your phrase and figuring out the distinction between the quantified self movement and ‘ordinary’ people.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>-- The idea that we have reached an obligatory passage points and that we're creating others versions of ourselves that we comply to is why I'm fascinated by the quantified self-movement. I believe we are extending ourselves into another platform. It is not us but it is us at the same time. Instagram for example becomes the way that I see, react and understand you but it's not really you. But this ‘scrolling memory list’ also becomes the way that you see and think about yourself. So can the quantified self-movement can be a preliminary model for what's happening to the self? </strong>
                                <br><br>
                                I think you're absolutely right. The quantified self is a really good example. There's a phrase that Lupton uses in her book, The Quantified Self, called ‘the spectacular body’.<span class="footnote"></span> The spectacular body describes a curious situation where for example you go to the doctor. Let’s say you are an alien watching a doctor's consultation with a patient. As the alien, you might think that the patient was actually the screen because the doctor spends more time looking at the screen with the patient than looking at their actual patient. There's a spectacular or quantified or visualized representation of the self on the screen that is more of importance to the doctor or appears to be.
                                <br><br>
                                I believe the same thing happens when uploading ourselves through Instagram or Strava or so forth. Cyber-utopians see uploading everything as a great thing. Some of the zealots in the quantified self-movement imagine a future when we become disembodied, becoming these floating souls somehow better than our fleshly selves. I wonder if this singularity wish is wedded into the old Christian notion that the body is the source of sin and the transcendent body is the where the godliness is. This notion is so shackled to a particular Western logic that is unhelpful.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>--So we’ve basically established that quantifying the world and datafication is something that is not isolated to a single movement.  Whether we like or not, were part of this evolution. Whether we are complicit in it or in reaction to it, we're trying to not comply.  Quantifying the world and datafication are thus not isolated to a movement. How would or is it impacting the graphic design industry? Especially as you are the BA course leader, for the course (BA Graphic Communication Design). </strong>
                                <br><br>
                                That's a nice question. I’ve given a lot of thought to how you build critical skills into what's traditionally been seen as a more instrumental form of education. In art schools, there's been a tendency to treat graphic designers as the commercial ugly stepsister of fine art, and also to treat it as the acquisition of very good instrumental skills, in order for you to go out, take orders and make things look pretty.
                                <br>
                                However, my absolute belief and mission is to bring critical thinking into the graphic design practice, which is not achieved with more art history classes. I think it's done through practice. It’s done with thinking-through-making. In that way, young designers are constantly required to contextualize their technical skills in the light of philosophy and constantly scrutinise their skills. This education is one wherein critical thinking-through-making sends more critically equipped thinkers out into the world of graphic design practice. These new thinkers can turn around to those who have traditionally given the orders, who’ve said “Make this look pretty”,  and say “What actually is that the problem? Or is there another problem behind the problem?”.
                                <br><br>
                                It is key to educate graduates to start their own project and find like-minded individuals willing to do things differently. We are at a crisis point, you know. I don't think any educator, or any intelligent educate for that matter, could not in good faith continue to believe the churning out graphic designers who are only capable of producing pretty things to sell more trash. We’re at a tipping point with climate change, population growth, city management etc. We desperately need critically equipped curious designers who can understand how to develop systems to support massive populations live in massive cities amid extreme weather, angelisation and the singularity.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>-- Do you think graphic designers have been complicit in allowing quantified data analysis and being to complicit in just agreeing to ‘order’? </strong>
                                <br><br>
                                Yes, it has been complicit because of the nature of how the profession was conceived, being born out of advertising and promotion. And unfortunately, in the early birth of graphic design, the secondary need of recognising the problematization of systems, the organisation of new systems and working with new problems in proactive ways was not part of the agenda. It was just to sell stuff and make it culturally appealing. 
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>
                                -- Jessica Helfand said something which stopped me in my tracks when she discussed how graphic design has done everything but save the world.<span class="footnote"></span> She made me think, ‘when has graphic design gone out advocating and criticising the world?’ When have our industry leaders constructively criticised or attempted to change the industry and/or the world?
                                <br><br>
                                But in light of what we have discussed, for myself and others part of the next generation, what are the most important things for us to do, understand and explore? As my course leader, what would your finals words wisdom be as I prepare to leave these walls at Central Saint Martins in five months? </strong>
                                <br><br>
                               
                                Remain curious and keep asking excellent questions. Keep asking and investigating with all of your intellectual and research powers. Thinking graphic designers are really needed in the world. That point about what should graphic designers be doing is really important. It is possible and you should build new networks of trust, care, resilience and informal economies and to contribute to resilient grassroots mechanisms that can help us withstand the onslaught of climate change, the singularity, housing crisis etc. There is hope. But one has to be focused, very focused.
                                <br><br>
                                One of the teachers of Hogwarts would always say have ‘constant vigilance’. It's a really challenging time. I’m so very happy that on this course there is room for people like yourself to explore these ethical and intellectual issues with all your heart and passion. So I guess I would say to all of you, keep doing it!

                                    My practice is a culmination of lessons and values of Kenneth Goldsmith, Dunne and Raby's speculative design methods, Metahaven’s production of written and visual speculative outcomes and using graphic design to question itself and the world. My practice strives to present 'alternative realities’ (not to predict outcomes) and speculate on humans behavioural, design and technological patterns.

                                    Ramia Mroué performed in Pixelated Revolution new methods for dissecting and looking at footage from the Syrian revolution. He demonstrated how to view the footage in methods outside the conventional, video as a purely passive cinematic experience, using active zooming,  focusing differently, stacking images to find the narrative to produce the story.

                                    <br><br>
                                    Although not directly, linked to the idea of what is a data file and is it a digital performance of computer code, Mroué shows how we can analyse media in a new way to reveal better/new meanings. Finding out a way and then presenting what our alternative experience of the data file might be, may involve taking data files and analysing them outside of the conventional methods.

                                    According to game theory in multiplayer systems, views and behavioural patterns that harm all players nevertheless take root and spread ie. taking a piece of cake means everyone else has less cake. It’s a zero-sum game. The loss and gains of all players always equal zero. However, the behaviour of the players doesn’t change. Or like the arms race where it bankrupts those that take part in them without changing the military balance of power. India develops nuclear bombs, so does Pakistan. Pakistan enlarges navy and India counters. Balance has not changed only benefited the arms racing pattern. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Do the dynamics of game theory apply to the externalisation of the self? When you improve digitally or externalise your memory as Bernard Stiegler noted it, do you lose physical capacity? Is it a zero-sum game or is it possible to gain positively in both realms? 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Any conversation about how social media and technology most often talk about the negative impact it has on humanity, our vanity, our sense of self-connection with the outside world. These are all valid discussion. However, I believe the discussion should perhaps involve how we can avoid a zero-sum game or if we are comfortable with game theory playing out for the externalised memory, identity and the self.

                                    --Bernard Stiegler, a French philosopher, question if industrial and large scale development of mnemotechnologies, devices involved in the practice of aiding memory, would constitute in a displacement of memory. Thus, the displacement of a mobile phone is equivalent to losing track of the numbers of people you are in contact with and consequentially the realisation occurs that they are no longer in one’s own memory but inside the device.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This theory of how mnemotechnologies structurally reformat how humans retain knowledge and memorise their lives is fascinating as it can be applied to the idea of ‘loss’ of self and identity. If we entertain the notion that we see each others' and our own identity, partially or wholly, through the presence and appearance of them and us online, does the loss of the device constitute the displacement of identity? Are these technologies not just displacing memory like Stiegler said, but also displacing our identities and what our notion of self is?

                                    Hito Steyerl discussed if images can be shared and circulated why can’t everything else, the internet is moving offline and so are our existence. As the internet moves offline, humans move online and so the lines are just becoming too blurry to tell the difference between online and offline, reality and virtuality. The idea that conversations about censorship, data protection are restricted to our online reality is not sensible, as it is human behaviour or not internet that is societies main tool.

                                    Reach out and touch yourself - that would be my advice to the contemporary person. To reconcile and understand yourself, you must look beyond the confines of contemporary philosophical and psychological thinking. The 'true' you lie not within. You cannot look inside to learn about yourself. Yourself does lie within not just within lies outside as well. Your self is not contained. Your self is fragmented across the physical and digital landscapes. You must reach out to touch yourself.

                                    Structuration theory dictates neither structures nor agency has primacy in shape our reality. <span class="footnote"></class> Structure being recurrent patterned arrangements which influence or limit choices available. Agency is the capacity to choose freely and act with independence. Anthony Giddens was a proponent of this theory of how people make society but are at the same time constrained by it.  In regard to technology Wanda Orlikowski <span class="footnote"></class> said it is technology and their users who enact the reproduction of existing structural conditions or they produce change that may lead to structural transformation. She showed how people bring about new societal structures which shape their use of technology that they then employ in practice back onto themselves.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Users do not appropriate technologies but create technology-in-practice. This is to say creating new societal structures through the actions and application of that technology. It is thus important to draw a line under that any modern social structure (or phenomena) is not at fault of the technology or its creator. The technology offers a structural landscape and the users act within with it with agency. The users actions in turn creates the traditions, norms, expectations within the technological systems. Technological institutions do not constrain the capacity of human action there is a dynamic relationship in the creation of meaning, standard and values that form the structure.

                          The first prototype had some issues. The injections didn’t allow for the reader to understand the point of the two critics,  book was very thin and flimsy and the format did not really lend itself to demonstrate my point.

                          So for the reader to understand the essays, the book would be mirrorred. You would read either critics essays first before being introduced the opinion of the other. The ‘battle’ would then climax in middle of the book and you would experience the other critics point of you view afterwards.

                          The book lacked a sense of hierarchy and clarity. There is an idea of adding several voices to open up and show how many opinions there are in this debate. Using different colours, and a strong system of what each type of interjections means. 
                          <br><br>
                          These voices would then be shown at the index at the end of the book, demonstrating the debate is endless, muddled and from multiple perspectives.

                          “Designers and non-designers (that means everyone), now is the time for jokes. A time for ridicule and laughter and protest and screaming and general strikes. A time to publicise, on a gut level, what we feel about those in power; a time to show them our deepest; cat-like instincts. Our messages will be seen shared and remembered. Loathe the austerity elites, deface and make the technocratic superstructure lifeless avatars. Spray-paint, overload, bombard, name and sham austerity’s guilty overlords with jokes that pass through each and every riot child. Jokes are a continuation of politics by other memes.” (Metahaven, 2013) <span class=”footnote”></span>

                          Hillary Clinton was probably one of America's least charismatic presidential politicians. But on the internet, her image took on a life of its own. It’s almost as if Hillary’s fans breathed charisma into her on social media. Her most charming moments could be put on an endless loop and passed around as totems of her character. She was at her most charismatic in GIF form. Meanwhile, Hillary’s opponents were working in the opposite direction, isolating moments that made her look deranged, ugly and sick.

                        Pierre Boekraad “discovered the images as the vehicle of social criticism and utopian desire” (Boekraad, 2007)<span class=”footnote”></span>. And so memes - these self-replicating units of culture - composing of just image and text with the raw power of mass replication to voice ideas to a massive audience can unsettle well-defined structures: of oppressed and oppressor, truth and lies, reality and fiction. Memes used to increase Hilary’s charisma can just as easily be implemented to topple well-established infrastructures, especially political ones. In the Guardian Haddow concurs “at their most basic, meme warfare present(s) an opportunity for individuals to seize control of the means of media production from corporate interests..” (Haddow, 2016)<span class=”footnote”></span> Italy has a famous example of this. Beppe Grillo’s Five Star Movement highly effective open ridicule of Monti’s technocratic austerity under the memetic slogan “Vaffanculo” lead them to achieve 25.5 of the Italian vote out of nothing, by integrating memes and jokes into politics. By becoming a form of media production shared millions of times in seconds and with the subverting humoristic nature, memes are politics most powerful weapon.
                        <br><br>
                        Political memes are now a form of propaganda. They tap into the collective memory and transform the outcome of a commonly held starting point to different ends. (Metahaven, 2013)<span class=”footnote”></span>  They allow the categorisation of something as nonsense. “The legitimacy and rationality of sense were left uncontaminated, unthreatened,” (Stewart, 2009)<span class=”footnote”></span> prior to the evolution of meme culture. It makes politics incredibly difficult to manoeuvre. A politicians job is to manage reality and to make sense of the world through negotiations and legislation. Yet, memes kill the ability to intelligently orchestrate a political conversation. Any moment can be manipulated into a positive or negative, depending on your allegiance. And because memes can morph to accommodate almost any position it’s easier than ever to take a candidate's’ image or opinions and twist them to our own ends. Facts don’t matter to memes.

                           In May 2016, Hilary publicly supported a legislative act which would require women to register for military drafting. Aimed at promoting gender equality in the military, this gesture, although purely symbolic, was a rare instance of bipartisan support in US politics. However, Ted Cruz twisted the message. He created a paranoid conspiracy claiming that the next war is imminent, and the corresponding memes took off like wildfire. Hilary’s bipartisan support vanished and the legislation never made it to Congress. Because memes don’t need to grapple with reality, they spread a lot faster than typical forms of political speech.

                         And in presidential politics, we’ve never seen anyone benefit from this more the Mr “You are fake news” Donald Trump. Trump had no clear ideology, the vaguest sketches of ideas, a bottomless thirst for attention, and a flair for drama: the perfect base for endless meme-ing. His campaign rallies became like incubators for ideas with viral potential. Think about the defining memes of Trumpism: “Draining the swamp”, ”Lock her up” and especially “We need to build a wall.” There was never any world where that the United State would build a 2,000-mile wall along the southern border - let alone that Mexico would pay for it. (A big, beautiful wall meme) Anytime reality tried to get in the way, Trump would double down on the meme. This has continued into the presidency, to the extent, he is willing to shut down his government for the longest period in history to get his meme built.

                         “All discourse bears reference to a commonly held world. The discourse of common sense refers to the real world. The discourse of nonsense refers to nothing. In other words, it refers to itself even though it must manufacture ‘manufacture’ this nothing out of a system of difference from the everyday world - the common stuff of social life - in order to be recognised as nothing."(Metahaven, 2013)<span class="footnote"></span>
                         <br><br>
                          Memes put a new twist on the old idea of charismatic authority in politics. Charismatic leaders used to imbue themselves with mythos claiming to possess special qualities and cults of personality around themselves. (Neuwirth, Weber, Eisenstadt, 1969) <span class=”footnote”></span>  But on the internet, a lot of that work has been transferred to citizens who take their leaders’ tics and blow them up into superhuman form. This process creates really strong tribal and emotional ties around those personalities. If you make a meme about a candidate and then they become president, it can feel like you created a piece of the presidential persona, like a part of you is president. Memes give us the power to build leaders’ personalities or destroy them. We used to talk about gaffes. The idea seems quaint now. Jair Bolsonaro called several women not even worthy of raping and black Brazilians only useful for procreation and Trump’s was caught on tape saying he could sexually assault women without contempt. This did little to damage their reputation amongst their supporters. Both men are now presidents. There’s no longer any fixed idea of a candidate to be disrupted by a gaffe. Our conception of politicians is now made up of sets of competing polarising memes like ‘grab em by the pussy.

                         Political memes are not just weapons politicians can utilise. They are rooted in our attempt to have more influence. For his biggest fans, Trump himself is the ultimate meme. “Designing memes can come to satisfy a movement hunger for new tools, pictures and messages as memes are a gateway for a gathering of activities exceeding the scope and scale of the individual, gaining the appearance of significance to form an organisation-without-organisation. (Metahaven, 2013)<span class="footnote"></span> Unfortunately, these organisation-without-organisations are turning politicians into avatars. We’re no longer just analyzing how candidates express themselves. We want to express ourselves through them. On the internet, our support of candidates is being encoded through these moments where they seem to represent us, not as actual political representatives voting for our interests, but as people acting how we’d like to imagine ourselves acting.  
                         <br><br>
                         They’ve become so invested in promoting their politicians' persona that the politicians' promises have become almost irrelevant, like outdated versions of a meme that have been replaced by the next amusing thing. We shouldn’t forget that Brexit was promised to boost Britain's economy and Trump was meant to drain swamps and make “everyone so tired of winning” because Americans would be winning all the time. That’s the seductive danger of democracy-as-meme. It can make us feel like we have more personal control over a politician. but it’s the politician who is seizing the real power, defying scrutiny and becoming less accountable to us.
                         <br><br>
                         It would not be a far stretch to say that the tools we use to communicate are counterproductive to actual communication. Our keyboards are being embedded with a repository of looping imagery, meshing with our language. It is easier to spread lies than to respond with truths. (Haddow, 2016)<span class=”footnote”></span> We can just imbue politicians with the values we want them to possess, whether it is building walls, universal basic income or taking back control. We live in a world of virtual conflict, but within this virtuality, the nature of reality is decided. Where the dictatorial-battering-ram, the meme, has turned common sense and truth into anarchistic beliefs. Into entire populations yelling at one another through 256-pixel images and cat videos. We must find a way for truth to be more plausible. Ironically, memes have the capacity to overturn any frame of references, even if it caused truth to become subjective in the first place.                        </h4>

                                  As a result of my current obsession with the ongoing encroachment of technology on our lives, I began to notice and make of this encroachment's physical manifestations. 
                                  <br><br>
                                  This September, I was visiting the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow. The museum boasts a collection of over 600,000 pieces of art from all across the planet. Each room is beautifully painted in muted colours and filled to the brim with centuries-old and contemporary sculpture, statues and paintings. It is hard not to be overwhelmed by the tsunami of masterpieces, whilst itching to photograph everything. Despite this, my entire fascination quickly fell away from the art and onto on all the supposedly unremarkable dehumidifiers, heaters, plugs, cameras, routers and speakers in the museum. They were so conspicuously placed; not hidden away but located as if they had equal importance to a Picasso or a 3000BC Egyptian statue. The devices disrupted the space. They garnered attention and it all felt bizarre. 
                                  <br><br>
                                  I decided to photograph all of the devices as a document of this feeling. Important to note that I was not looking to make some large revelation on how, for example, our lives are being taken over by technology without us noticing. Others have conducted more encompassing and thought-provoking explorations. Sapir Ziv (Ziv, 2018)<span class="footnote"></span> explored the physicality and disconcerting presence of surveillance cameras, and James Bridle documented all CCTV cameras, signs of the invisible electromagnetic spectrum communication devices and cloud storage facilities around London. (Bridle, 2014)<span class="footnote"></span> So ‘better' projects are out there, but my photographs from the Pushkin represent a metaphor for this feeling I and I believe many have. The old familiar, well-understood, highly ornamented and visible is being merged by the new, obscure, simple and the opaque. It feels different, unfamiliar, and disruptions are often done subtly. All these devices next to Impressionist masterpieces, antique sculptures and Egyptian sarcophagus exemplified that disruption to me. It is unnatural, unremarkable at a glance but disturbing over time.

                                  Early in the exploration, All Cameras are Police Cameras, Bridle stated that the proliferation of (surveillance) systems follows the “expansion of capitalism itself into the realm of everyday life.” (Bridle, 2014)<span class="footnote"></span> We have only started to see this proliferation of technology that has happened recently. We didn't understand the systems that were being created, and now, upon noticing them, we are left with a feeling of powerlessness, bewilderment and awe. Thus, because we do not have an understanding of the burgeoning network and surveillance society, we feel that we have no meaningful choices (or consent) to influence the disruption it is causing to our once familiar world… The Devices of Pushkin is the metaphor for that feeling.                                  <br><br>

                              <h4> 
                                Most people will tell you that they "care" about online privacy. 74 percent of Americans say it's very important that they control who can obtain their personal information (Raine, 2018)<span class="footnote"></span>. I don't believe it. People say they care, but people don't actually care and it is a well-documented fact. We have a tendency towards privacy-compromising behaviour online, resulting in a dichotomy between privacy attitudes and actual behaviour (Acquisti 2004, Barnes 2006)<span class="footnote"></span><span class="footnote"></span>. There is so much discussion on regaining and retaining our privacy but as individuals we do almost nothing. This discrepancy between our online behaviour and our actual actions is called the privacy paradox (Barnes 2006)<span class="footnote"></span>.
                                <br><br>
                                The privacy paradox applies to everything on the internet because every company in the world is collecting and using our personal information. And yes, it's every company. How many emails did you receive when the EU brought in the new GDPR rules? It wasn't just multinational tech corporations but even smaller companies' website or apps we visited or bought something from a decade ago messaged to tell you, "We're committed to managing and safeguarding the information you give us... Please opt-in" (I know that all those emails went directly to the trash, btw). Everything you have ever done, liked and thought about is stored in some air-conditioned storage facility. Yet, we continue to watch, scroll, tap, message, and browse incessantly without thought or care.
                                <br><br>
                                We consider data collection too narrowly and therefore disregard our privacy. “Who cares if Facebook knows I listened to Childish Gambino or went to Sainsbury’s? They don’t have my password or credit card details”. As long as our obviously sensitive data is ‘safe’ we reduce the less significant data collection as inconsequential and trivial. However, everytime one of us receives a hyper specific ad we bemoan the terrifying reality of companies knowing too much about us. This proves that people are aware that “any personal information can become sensitive information” (Ted Talks, 2013)<span class="footnote"></span> and that all the stand-alone information fragments are stored, analysed and used actively with astonishing precision. So why don’t we do anything to protect our privacy? I think there are four primary reasons why our behaviours and actions will not change and why the privacy paradox will persist.
                                <br><br>
                                One, I strongly believe it's because the collection of our personal information is invisible. We may understand it but we don’t see what we are handing over. Let's draw a comparison. If your waiter asked you to give him all your contacts, your phone number, put a location-tracker on you and give him a transcript of all your online conversation in order to eat at a Wagamama restaurant, there is simply no way you would agree to it. However, this is what tech companies ask of us to use their services and we don't batter an eye. It is all obscured behind our glossy screens. We are completely disconnected from the disclosure and the consequences of the information exchange, mainly a fault of the services design.
                                <br><br>
                                Secondly, there is a problem with how we are asked to allow data collection. It's done through terms of service and privacy policies. These agreements are a joke. They do not help users at all and they are designed and written in a way that makes reading them impractical at best and extremely unlikely in practice. It would take the average person 201 hours a year to read all the terms of service of all the websites they visit. (McDonald and Cranor, 2008)<span class="footnote"></span> &#x1F926;&#x1F3FE;&#x200D;&#x2642;&#xFE0F;So the obvious result is that we either don’t read them or simply ignore them. People may also just blindly trust them. We may think if privacy policies were that bad, would our governments not step in? Wouldn't they regulate it? But even if governments did regulate it's always done in retrospect, and most companies are aware of the psychological dynamics that prevent us from safeguarding our privacy effectively. “Various sometimes, subtle factors can be used to activate or suppress privacy concerns, which in turn affect behaviour”(Acquisti, Brandimarte and Loewenstein, 2018) <span class="footnote"></span>. Unless, users actually read the agreements there is no way to guarantee they don't continue to get exploited.
                                <br><br>
                                Furthermore, the human tendency to ignore whatever is hard to see and the design surrounding terms of service means that any person with conviction can collect and exploit human’s information. People are indoctrinated to "tick here to agree" without second thought. I actually conducted <a href="jonathanjournal.html#disclaimer" target="_blank"> an investigation &rarrhk;</a> into this phenomenon, by asking a hundred individuals to fill out a physical form asking for their age, height, weight, nationality, etc. and followed by ten personal questions. The questions were designed to allow me to obtain similar specific information like what Facebook can deduce from their data about their users i.e. “how many times have you travelled in the last year?”, “how many selfies have you taken this month?” or “how many times have you called your parents this week?” Then afterwards, the individual would have to sign the form, attesting that their answers and personal information could be used in any way possible. Everyone signed it, and only one person read it. It poignantly demonstrated how little we consider the use and loss of our personal information.
                                <br><br>
                                Lastly, Acquisiti, Brandimarte and Loewenstein also described that our will to protect our privacy is being overpowered by our deep-seated instinct to share. (Acquisti, Brandimarte and Loewenstein, 2018)<span class="footnote"></span>. Online has become the place to fill that instinct instantly. We have a need to be social, to share, to receive validation and the internet makes all so easy. The interactions we use to have at a more local level between family, friends and your community has been replaced by tweets, posts and likes. Online sharing and validation from it is now so embedded in our culture that it trumps any fear of data theft, privacy and misuse, so we happily hand over our information blindly without consideration for the consequence. Tech companies exploit this, and all other institutions today benefit from it. Our banks, our travel agencies, our fashion companies all benefit from the access to the massive reservoir of everyone's personal information. Our world is a place of total visibility, transparency and accessibility, but people benefit massively from it, and therefore privacy concerns are disregarded.
                                <br><br>
                                We are disconnected from the disclosure and the consequences of information exchange, services are obscured and we continue to share endlessly. We have unconsciously constructed this phenomenon where the world’s hottest commodity, humans, and all their information and their identity, are all publically on display, to be viewed, scrutinised and bought or obtained as easily getting milk from the supermarket. Just like the privacy paradox states, we express a desire to protect our personal information but that desire has no resemblance to world we are creating. It should be in our best interest to change the status quo and gain back some control. Maybe we could just change human behaviour, but that is unlikely to ever happen. The system itself is broken and is breaking with huge new privacy controversies appearing so regularly it feels like if our behaviour was ever going to change, it should have changed by now.
                                <br><br>
                                There is plenty of work to do, so we better get started but I'm just going to go buy this thing that Instagram showed me an ad for. I'll be back... as soon as I have actually started to care about my privacy.

                               <h4>In conjunction with Identity Theft? Pt1 I wanted to see if anyone with conviction could collect and exploit individuals' private information, not due to the prevalence of the internet or social media but due to people’s behavioural traits and their relationship to privacy and sharing. 
                                   <br><br>
                                   Today, anyone can find mountains of information about another, create psychoanalytical profiles, sell the data and use it in any way they see fit. It doesn’t require you being a multinational conglomerate tech firm to do so. Three clicks, one Google search and CTRL + C is all it takes.  Yet, I had a feeling the ease of it might be less to do with the systems we’ve built but the way humans’ are hardwired.
                                   <br><br>
                                   How did we collect information before the internet? Prior, the only way to accurately obtain data was through data forms and surveys. They were effective ways to get precisely the information you were looking for without having to dissect a million terabytes of metadata [arhm... NSA], but much slower to obtain. to dissect and understand afterwards when applied on a mass scale.  Conducting my own old-school mass collection of personal information purely with physical forms could reveal new things about our relationship to privacy and data today, so that’s what I did.
                                   <br><br>

                               <div class="inline-caption"> <p><br><br>Sketchbook research & documentation -- looking at data collection forms</p>
                                </div>

                                   The data collection should feel serious and professional, but still something people wanted to engage with. The design should carry some familiarity as well, so it was about combining modern design traits with the conventional boxy layout of data forms. The questions should force the subject to answer questions unfamiliar to the usual forms and force them to think differently about themselves. The questions allowed me to obtain information similar to what by Facebook and the other Big 5 can understand from their users' data. The answers were restricted between 0 to 10+, so subjects’ focused purely on the questions and not the delivery of their answer (There is also a lot of fun in in ticking 10+). The form was printed on a heavier (155gsm) delicately bumpy textured paper made for children’s origami. This was all in an effort to drive engagement with the form and enjoy the process. The most important feature, the disclaimer, would give me full authorisation to use the information with impunity, was placed next to the signature.  I did decide not to ask for the subject’s name. It reveals a lot and would make people less likely to fill out the form (In hindsight, I think that was a mistake. People’s name is the all-important identity classifier and would have brought more validity to my investigation.). After a quick test, I walked around uni and London, asking people to fill out the form and sign it.
                                   <br><br>
                                <img src="projectmedia/Jonathan/journal/disclaimerProcess01.jpg"/>

                                    <br>
                                    Without meaning to be insensitive - it was stupidly easy! Only one person read the disclaimer, and not a single person refused to fill out the form. Two hours later, I had all 100 forms completed and signed. Often people asked what I’d use the information for, and I answered honestly, “I don’t know what I’ll use it for afterwards. I’m just testing out this form for a project. If you don’t feel comfortable, you shouldn’t fill it out”.  People found it engaging and took it very seriously looking at their phone to count “how many times they had travelled in the last year?” or “how many selfies they had taken?”. It seemed they found an escape and wanted to answer questions about themselves, something I hadn’t expected. In addition, to my delight and surprise, many people passing by seeing my brightly coloured forms asked to fill one out.

                                    To complete the project, the forms were bound to emulate a folder sitting in a file cabinet, ready to be distributed around the office. Originally, a photo of the subject was put next to each form, but it made each form too personal. This project was more about the number of forms and the disclaimer than an individual’s identity. Imagining what I could do with the information and how easy people make data collection possible, was more important than seeing the subject’s face. And with the cover being the disclaimer it reminds you of what is at stake.

                                    We voluntarily give away our data for anyone to use. I attempted to demonstrate how we willingly give away personal information for anyone to exploit. The project reveals and reaffirms [to me] our complacency around personal data and challenges today’s critique that it is primarily the Big 5 and the Internet itself fault for data exploitation. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    How do we stop allowing the exploitation of ourselves and when will we realise that our identity is the most valuable thing? Because if a student can gather specific personal information of 100 individuals in two hours with a paper form (that would take Facebook six months to accurately conclude), whilst getting them to consent his ability to use the data for anything, society has to start scrutinising human behaviour more specifically and not just simply technology.

The book made me ask questions like: What happens to our impression of people when taken out of their
                                  context? What does it say about society that we are all collectors of data? Who has the power to collect data and by extension people’s indentity? It did learn that it was a mistake to write data on the
                                  cover as it robbed the audience of discovering the book’s premise themselves. The book lead me on to Identity Theft PT1...<br><br>

                             <br> The first publication pushed me to focus on people and how they present themselves online. An article piece by Italian Philosopher Gloria Origgi <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/say-goodbye-to-the-information-age-its-all-about-reputation-now" target="_blank"><span class="footnote"></span></a> brought 
                                  clarity to my project, describing how “From the “information age,” we are moving towards the “reputation age,” in which information will have value only if it is already filtered, evaluated, and commented upon by others.” To build on my previous book, I would collect online
                                  “information” and filter it into a publication that would reveal a new form of information. People’s true identity. <br>
                             <br> The book would comprise of 50 people’s liked pages on Facebook and their profile picture. It would show how willingly we literally “present” personal information that can be harvested by anyone, and in this case, easily reveal what kind of a person we are. In hindsight, adding a
                                  brief description may have helped the audience enter the book. Yet, I did want the audience to be surprised and learn the premise, rather than be informed of it like in the previous publication.<br><br>

                              <br> Data art often takes a critical look at our society. It reprsesent the underlying links that exists between the ubiquitious in our lives. Our world is almost entirely governed by algorithms but the way we are goverened are often allowed by decisions the user makes prior to using different platforms. 
                                   I really wanted to demonstrate the latter. So combined  the data collected with a visualisation. The subject’s profile picture would become the data visualisation adding new meanings to the raw data, by distorting it according to the amount of liked pages.                        
                                   The audience thus gets better understanding of what the data means. <br><br>

                                      To communicate how revealing our data can be, but show even more just how much we willingly give away. I just had to find someone who had enough of an online presence that a whole book could be made about it. It was not very hard to find.

                             too much away. And I wanted to demonstrate, that data as it is collected in its original form can reveal new meanings.<br><br>

The relationship humans have with their identity and method for presenting(and representing) it are changing. These public and private spheres are no longer existing in isolation, they are intersecting.

                              My creative practice focus lies in this intersection I call "the Interzone". What happens to the human as these two phenomenon collide? What does a world look like it when it is not just the outside world that is designed, but when design reaches into our minds? Is there a future where the human still exists? The human and its self are becoming fully integrated into the modern social and economic structures, and they have the ability to incessantly design and curate their 'never finished profiles.' The methods for projecting, designing and exploiting the self today are nearly limitless.
